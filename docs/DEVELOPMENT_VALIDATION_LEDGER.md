# Carthago Development and Deferred Validation Ledger

**Owner-controlled execution gate:** PARKED. All builds, .NET/xUnit runs,
benchmarks, replays, holdout evaluations, source-contract checks and GitHub
Actions jobs require explicit authorization from the project owner
("now it's test time"). Preparing checks and documenting them is permitted;
their presence does not imply successful execution.

**Development track:** Complete the R102 binary-DNS wire-name and original
capture provenance foundation **before** expanding the remaining detector
rules. Keep the single existing branch
`feature/carthago-reliability-hardening`. Preserve the frozen V1 failure,
all R102 thresholds/confidence weights and benign controls, and V2
`PENDING_EXTERNAL_CAPTURE_AND_REVIEW` until separate authorization.

This is the **central step ledger**, not a replacement for detailed design,
protocol, fixture or forensic source documents. Each future change must append
a dated entry describing the changed file/commit, decision, authored test,
validation command, parked or observed outcome, evidence boundary, and next
gate. Never mark an unexecuted check green.

## Current evidence and decisions — 2026-10-29

| ID | Item | Evidence / state | Next gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E01 | Original Korving-F `bind9/dns.pcap` | SHA-256 `b9c5ec5b6a50facb8719ffe47656d2cda0f0704ed08d91130c8b48a3e0ddf102` pinned; source Git blob `c061d953b9e21068031d604b9c1001ddcd1cfa53` | Private original capture must be present for each future selected-frame audit |
| E02 | Binary-name research | 15,942 frames, 7,991 TXT questions, 5,335 names passing the legacy printable policy, 2,656 wire-valid binary-name exclusions; TShark 4.2.2 and 4.6.9 corroboration recorded in source review | Validate codec and importer against original frame bytes |
| E03 | Selected-frame independent corroboration | Separate raw-frame decoder matched TShark 4.2.2 `jsonraw` for **121/121** DNS messages, checked QTYPE 121/121, including 41 printable and 80 text-policy-excluded questions; no names or source IPs published | Repeat selected-frame test with production PowerShell contract and TShark 4.6.9 on CARTHAGE, once authorized |
| E04 | Apparently separate sources | Both PCAP source/root groups share 3,977 identical distinct QNAMEs; **not** independent malicious clients merely because two source addresses appear | Collect separate originating-client/session evidence and human label/licensing review |
| E05 | Frozen V1 / candidate V2 | Preserve known R102 V1 miss; V2 contains eight immutable R118/R163 predecessor fixtures and four unapproved R102 slots, **0/4** candidate approvals | Never auto-promote, relabel, import or freeze |
| D01 | Selected design | Approach A: canonical Base64 **per original DNS label**, exact label octets, ASCII-case-only identity, optional private provenance, no reversible fields in ordinary telemetry | Execute test-first implementation stages |
| D02 | Why R102 first | It currently loses binary label octets and therefore misses independent detection evidence; broad rule expansion would compound the unresolved accuracy risk | Complete and review R102 pathway before adding batches |
| D03 | One GitHub Actions entry point | Reuse `.github/workflows/carthago-detection-quality.yml` with an authorization-gated profile selector; retire the redundant focused, one-shot, and baseline YAML definitions from the development branch | No workflow dispatch until owner authorization |

## Parked implementation and validation matrix

All commands are **prepared instructions**, not evidence of executions.
The exact implementation plan lives in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-29-dns-wire-name-provenance.md`.

| Stage | Planned implementation / contract | Parked validation and acceptance | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `DnsWireNameCodec`: original byte labels, canonical Base64, 255-octet DNS limit, compression bounds, ASCII-only case identity | `dotnet test Carthago.Tests/Carthago.Tests.csproj -c Release --filter "FullyQualifiedName~DnsWireNameCodecTests"`; observe expected **RED** before code, then **GREEN** | Test authored, **RED NOT RUN** |
| 2 | `PacketHandler` + `TrafficRecord`: preserve binary bytes while keeping safe legacy `DnsQname` and default JSON redaction | Focus `DnsWirePacketTests` plus `PacketHandlerLinkLayerTests`; validate UDP/TCP and no replacement characters | Test authored; **RED NOT RUN** |
| 3 | R102-only opt-in to wire-based evidence and original-byte entropy/distinctness, preserving existing thresholds | Focus `R102BinaryDnsPrecisionTests`, `R102DistinctTxtCorrelationTests`, `R102AdvancedAccuracyBatchTests`, and `DnsReplayTelemetryDiagnosticsTests`; precision, recall, F1 and privacy review | Ten named test methods authored; **RED NOT RUN** |
| 4 | Private replay hydrator with strict version, legacy-name consistency and default-JSON exclusion | Focus `DnsWireReplayHydratorTests` plus pinned V2 contract; verify conflicting names fail closed | Nine named test methods authored; **RED NOT RUN** |
| 5 | TShark original-frame/private-PCAP decoder and bounded binary-name source inspector | `powershell.exe -NoProfile -File scripts/verify-dns-wire-source-contract.ps1 -TsharkPath 'C:\Program Files\Wireshark\tshark.exe'`; compare frame, question ordinal, name octets, QTYPE and transport | DESIGN READY / PARKED |
| 6 | Importer/auditor exact PCAP hash, frame/ordinal, byte labels, source/session independence and strict fixture schema | Focus `SyntheticHoldoutV2ContractTests` and private source contract; reject tampering, same-frame reuse and mirrored clients | DESIGN READY / PARKED |
| 7 | Versioned V2 readiness/evaluator/freeze integration; preserve V1 hashes, acceptance floor and V2 pending | V2 contract plus readiness-only inspection; **no freeze/evaluation** without separate owner approval | DESIGN READY / PARKED |
| 8 | Whole-feature acceptance | One controlled Windows full regression, benchmark/replay and separately pinned holdout **only at test time**; record counts, warnings, SHA and original frozen V1 miss | NOT AUTHORIZED |
| B01 | Remaining five-rule development batches | `scripts/verify-all-rule-batches.ps1 -HoldoutVersion v1`; for each rule require at least five advanced cases; run the suite exactly once when authorized | BACKLOG, not the active path |

## One centralized GitHub Actions workflow

The workflow has **only** `workflow_dispatch`: there is no automatic
`push`, `pull_request` or scheduled test. Every job is further guarded
by the exact explicit input `authorization = NOW_TEST_TIME`.
Only CARTHAGE may execute a job; a hostname check precedes checkout.
No test logs or replay artifacts are uploaded; private output stays on
the runner. An authorization token **is not** a substitute for the
project owner's decision to initiate the run.

| Profile | Scope | Current gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dns-wire-codec` | Stage 1 focused RED/GREEN | PARKED |
| `dns-wire-packet` | Stage 2 focused parser compatibility | PARKED; test authored, not executed |
| `r102-accuracy` | Stage 3 R102/diagnostics regression | PARKED; test authored, not executed |
| `dns-wire-replay` | Stage 4 private replay hydration and pinned V2 contract | PARKED; test authored, not executed |
| `dns-source-contract` | Stage 5 synthetic PCAP and TShark | PARKED; script pending |
| `v2-contract` | Stage 6/7 strict V2 schema and source/fixture contract | PARKED |
| `v2-readiness` | Read-only V2 manifest/source readiness | PARKED |
| `rule-batches` | Complete advanced five-rule and frozen V1 acceptance | PARKED |
| `baseline` | Prior main Windows restore/build/xUnit baseline | PARKED |
| `detection-quality` | Previous quiet build, alert-level replay, pinned holdout and benign false-positive checks | PARKED |
| `full-verification` | Previous one-shot full verifier plus separate frozen V1 holdout | PARKED |

Manual `workflow_dispatch` requires a workflow available on the repository's
default branch. The existing detection-quality workflow already exists
there; the **new profile selector on the feature branch is not certified
operational** until GitHub resolves the selected ref to the new definition.
No dispatch may be used as a probe before explicit test time.

The legacy `windows-ci.yml` previously ran on main pushes/PRs. Its
automatic trigger is intentionally parked in this consolidation; restoring
continuous integration after approval is a distinct owner-controlled change.
Deleting obsolete YAML definitions does **not** erase their recoverable
Git history.

### R102 deferred evidence and privacy checkpoint

- **Source:** a synthetic-only test module at `Carthago.Tests/R102BinaryDnsPrecisionTests.cs` on the same development branch; no live packet or frozen holdout values are duplicated.
- **Positive contract:** three independently observed high-entropy binary-label TXT names from one attributed source and root must produce distinct-count evidence 1, 2, 3 without lowering `PrecisionProfile.MinimumConfidence = 80` or promoting an unready baseline out of Shadow.
- **Negative contracts:** identical packet-ID replay, new packet with the same name, case-only label variations, and a second observed source address must not inflate per-client distinct-name confidence. Unattributed UDP/TCP, malformed/noncanonical Base64, and 40-byte labels that expand to 56 Base64 characters must not become positive evidence. Binary ACME validation remains excluded.
- **Privacy contract:** binary-name events must not publish reversible Base64, synthesized `?`/replacement-character names, raw source identity, or the generic `dns.qname` evidence item. Structural length/entropy/count metadata remains available. The current shared `DnsPrecisionDetectionRuleBase.MatchDns` emits text-based `dns.qname`, and `DetectionEvent` carries source IP metadata; R102 needs a narrow privacy-safe event path before any binary-name promotion. This is an **identified design risk**, not a tested or fixed defect.
- **Pending execution:** run `dotnet test Carthago.Tests/Carthago.Tests.csproj -c Release --filter "FullyQualifiedName~R102BinaryDnsPrecisionTests|FullyQualifiedName~R102DistinctTxtCorrelationTests|FullyQualifiedName~R102AdvancedAccuracyBatchTests|FullyQualifiedName~DnsReplayTelemetryDiagnosticsTests"` on verified CARTHAGE only after explicit test-time authorization, with first-failure and final-success evidence and no new warnings. No detection-quality estimate is valid until the labeled replay and benign cohorts have been evaluated separately.

### Private replay deferred-hydration checkpoint

- **Source:** synthetic in-memory `Carthago.Tests/DnsWireReplayHydratorTests.cs`; no source PCAP, corpus file or default serializable raw label property is added.
- **Positive contract:** a sample with the explicit `dnsWireNameEncoding = labels-base64-v1` marker can hydrate exact original Base64 label strings into an in-memory `RuleReplaySample`, preserving the legacy ASCII field when it denotes the same case-insensitive wire name.
- **Negative contract:** absent/unsupported version, contradicting `DnsQname`, invalid padding bits, unexpected private debug fields, misaligned record counts and mixed valid/invalid multi-record input must fail closed with **no partially hydrated records**. Historical legacy samples lacking wire metadata remain unchanged.
- **Privacy contract:** the default `System.Text.Json` serialization of a hydrated replay sample must omit the reversible label collection. Hydration is explicit and private; ordinary replay deserialization must not silently authorize wire values.
- **Pending execution:** run `dotnet test Carthago.Tests/Carthago.Tests.csproj -c Release --filter "FullyQualifiedName~DnsWireReplayHydratorTests|FullyQualifiedName~SyntheticHoldoutV2ContractTests"` on CARTHAGE after owner authorization, observing RED before any hydration implementation and GREEN after minimal implementation. Existing V1 and pending V2 fixture hashes remain frozen.

**Read-only state check:** the feature branch now lists exactly one file in
`.github/workflows/`: `carthago-detection-quality.yml`. The cancelled
workflow runs have no recorded execution steps; their cancellation/skipped
conclusions are not counted as test evidence. The single central workflow
has not been dispatched.

## Required future entry template

- **Date / step ID / commit / file:** exact identifiers; one file per code commit.
- **Intent and boundary:** what was changed, and what intentionally remains unchanged.
- **Regression authored:** test name, synthetic scenarios, negative controls, privacy checks.
- **Execution status:** `PARKED`, `RED OBSERVED`, `GREEN OBSERVED`, or
  `FAILED`; never infer a result from source review or a successful commit.
- **When authorized, validate:** exact command, CARTHAGE hostname, source
  SHA, exit code, counts and private artifact location; document any known
  preexisting failures separately from regressions.
- **Decision / next gate:** threshold, provenance, licensing, source-label,
  or freeze approval that remains outstanding.
